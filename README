Welcome to the Automate Verification Discord Bot repository! ðŸ¤–

Are you tired of manually verifying participant entries for challenges like 30 days of code, code-everyday, or open-source-september? Say goodbye to time-consuming verification processes and hello to automation with our Discord bot!

## Problem Statement

Scaler frequently hosts challenges on its Discord server, where participants need to post their daily progress on Discord and/or share it on Twitter or LinkedIn. The current manual verification process is time-consuming for admins and Scaler stars. It's time to make the verification process faster and more efficient using a Discord bot.

**Important Note:** This problem statement is open-ended, allowing you to innovate and create a Discord bot that utilizes the Discord API to automate various verification tasks.

## Features and Ideas

Our Discord bot can assist with automating the verification process and offer several features, including:

1. **Daily Progress Tracking:** Participants can tag the bot or use a specific bot command when posting on Discord, linking their tweets or LinkedIn posts. The bot will record the user's entry for the day.

2. **Automatic Disqualification:** If a user fails to make a daily post, the bot will automatically mark them as ineligible for rewards.

3. **Format Verification:** The bot can check the format of tweets or LinkedIn posts to ensure they meet the challenge's requirements (e.g., proper hashtags, attached screenshots). It will also keep track of a participant's streak.

4. **Eligibility Tags:** After the challenge ends, moderators can filter entries based on tags set by the bot, making it easy to distinguish between eligible and ineligible participants.

5. **Effortless Rewards Distribution:** The bot can include a feature to distribute tokens to eligible participants with a single click, provided the bot has the necessary permissions.

6. **Export to PDF or Doc:** Generate and share a list of eligible participants in Discord, simplifying the reward distribution process.

## Key Benefits

By using this Discord bot, you'll experience several key benefits:

- **Time and Effort Savings:** Mods and admins can say goodbye to time-consuming manual verifications and focus on other important tasks.

- **Faster Reward Delivery:** Eligible participants can receive their rewards more quickly, enhancing their experience and satisfaction.

- **Streamlined Process:** The bot simplifies the entire verification and reward distribution process, making it efficient and hassle-free.

## Tech Stack

Our Discord bot leverages the following technologies:

- **Python 3.8+:** The core programming language for bot development.
- **Discord API:** Utilizing Discord API v2 to interact with the Discord server and messages.
